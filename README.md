# Real-Time Camera Image Classifier using Machine Learning

Real-Time Camera Image Classifier using Machine Learning is a Python-based application that allows users to classify images captured from their webcam. The application leverages a simple machine learning model (LinearSVC) to categorize images into two predefined classes. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and OpenCV is used to handle the webcam input.

## Features

- **Real-time Webcam Capture:** The application captures images in real time using your computer's webcam.

- **Image Classification:** Classify images into two user-defined categories using a trained SVM model.

- **Automatic Prediction:** An optional auto-prediction mode that continuously classifies the webcam feed in real-time.

- **Reset Functionality:** Easily reset the model and start a new classification session.

- **GUI with Tkinter:** A user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction with the application.
